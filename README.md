# Chaos Engineering
## Why Chaos Engineering
There are many reasons to do chaos engineering. We see teams transitioning in this way to reduce incidents, lower downtime costs, train their teams, and prepare for critical moments. Practicing chaos engineering allows you to detect problems before they become accidents and before customers are affected. And chaos engineering is useful for reducing downtime costs because it allows teams to have a resilient architecture. While the number of companies operating at Internet scale increases and high-traffic events such as sales or launches increase, the cost of downtime will become more expensive. Additionally, this continuous practice of chaos engineering gives teams more confidence every day as they build their own applications and systems. It takes less time to fire-fighting and more time to create and create value.

## How to do Chaos Engineering
To implement Chaos Engineering, one should follow the scientific method to implement experiments:
1. Observe your system
1. Baseline your metrics
1. Define Steady State
1. Form a Hypothesis with Abort Conditions (Blast Radius)
1. Run Experiment
1. Analyze Results
1. Expand Scope and Re-Test
1. Share Results

# AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)
[AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS that makes it easier to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resiliency. Fault injection experiments are used in chaos engineering, which is the practice of stressing an application in testing or production environments by creating disruptive events, such as sudden increase in CPU or memory consumption, observing how the system responds, and implementing improvements. For more details, please visit [what is](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is.html) page.

## Getting started
### AWS CLI
Follow the official guide to install and configure profiles.
- [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [AWS CLI Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)

After the installation is complete, you can check the aws cli version:
```
aws --version
aws-cli/2.5.8 Python/3.9.11 Darwin/21.4.0 exe/x86_64 prompt/off
```

### Terraform
Infrastructure Engineering team is using terraform to build and manage infrastucure for DevOps. And we have a plan to migrate cloudformation termplate to terraform.

To install Terraform, find the appropriate package (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for your system and download it. Terraform is packaged as a zip archive and distributed as a single binary. Install Terraform by unzipping it and moving it to a directory included in your system's `PATH`. The [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) is very useful solution.

And there is an another option for easy install.
```
brew install tfenv
```
You can use this utility to make it ease to install and switch terraform binaries in your workspace like below.
```
tfenv install 0.12.18
tfenv use 0.12.18
```
Also this tool is helpful to upgrade terraform v0.12. It is a major release focused on configuration language improvements and thus includes some changes that you'll need to consider when upgrading. But the version 0.11 and 0.12 are very different. So if some codes are written in older version and others are in 0.12 it would be great for us to have nice tool to support quick switching of version.
```
tfenv list
tfenv use 0.12.18
tfenv use 0.11.14
tfenv install latest
tfenv use 0.12.18
```

# Known Issues
## Unknown parameter
You might see error like belows if your aws cli does not support log configuration parameter of aws fis command. Upgrade your aws cli when you see that. This module requires aws cli version 2.5.8 or higher.
```
module.awsfis.null_resource.awsfis-init (local-exec): Parameter validation failed:
module.awsfis.null_resource.awsfis-init (local-exec): Unknown parameter in input: "logConfiguration", must be one of: clientToken, description, stopConditions, targets, actions, roleArn, tags
```
